# Maven Overview

Maven a tool developed by Apache to support their software development project initially released on 13 July 2004.  
Maven allows for software project management, and software project reporting by providing an overview and visualization 
of the project.  Maven, often known technically as mvn is open source and license as Apache License 2.0.  I view the 
tool as one of the earliest tools that reconciled Java development software project activity automation into a single 
framework.  The use of XML, made its adoption in the software development world rapid, and championed by XML connoisseurs.
